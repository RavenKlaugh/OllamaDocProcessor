# OllamaDocProcessor
OllamaDocProcessor is a Python-based utility that processes text, PDF, and Word documents through Ollama-compatible LLM APIs. It automatically extracts text from different document formats, chunks large documents to fit context windows, and sends them to the specified model for analysis, summarization, or other text transformations.
